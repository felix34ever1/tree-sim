# tree-sim
 Simulates growing plants with genetics and mutations.

## Plan:
1. ~~Create grid engine using pygame~~
2. ~~Create tiles which hold cells.~~
3. ~~Create tree class which holds all its cells.~~
4. ~~Create genome.~~ 
5. Add mutations.

## Known Bugs:
- Seeds that spawn on the bottom layer of the grid will just die when the original plant dies instead of being planted.
- Plant timer ticks down before plant is planted
